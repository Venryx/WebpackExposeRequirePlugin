WebPack expose `require` outside of bundle
==========================================

This is usefull for testing any module by using selenium and keeping tests and source code aside.
In other words there is no global variables (expect exposed require function), 
but if needed we can access any module functionality.

ToDo:

* Prepare example
* Setup module better, and setup dist file for `npm` package manager.
* Write tests.
